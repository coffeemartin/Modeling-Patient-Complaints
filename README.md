# Modeling-Patient-Complaints
Health care system, has always been one of the key sectors in the societies. With the current global pandemic
environment, the emergency department has been under enormous pressure to keep up with the demand.
It is inevitable that complaints from patients may often be made against doctors. The dramatic increase in
the size and frequency of medical complaints over the last decade, has made the development of modeling
on related issues, increasingly important (Burce Cooil (1991)). The background for complaints is related
both to the doctor and medical practice in general, as well as to the patients (Bianca Hanganu (2022)).
The aim for this paper is to identify a model, that provides predictions and explanations of the number
of claims for a certain doctor, based on doctorâ€™s social-demographic and professional characteristics. The
data file given by the unit coordinator, contains 94 doctors records who worked in an emergency service at
a hospital. We analysis the number of the complaints each doctor received in one year of time, based on
doctors gender, residency training status, hourly income and the total number of hours the doctor worked
in a year. The analysis will help us explore and discover which measurement may affect the changes in the
number of complaints.<br>

A zero inflated poisson model was fitted to the data. The model has revealed that, the doctors who had
more numbers of total patient visits in one year, are more likely to receive an increasing number of total
complaints during that time frame, a factor change of 1.15 per 100 increase in the total number of patient
visits. Doctors with higher hourly income rate or more accumulated working hours are more likely to receive
less number of complaints, a factor change of 0.991 per 1 dollar increase in hourly rate, and a factor change
of 0.92 per 100 increase in the number of hours worked in a year respectively.<br>

Moreover, being female without any residency training, or being male with residency training , increase the
odds of receiving no complaint significantly, comparing with the group of being female doctors with residency
training, or male without any residency training.
